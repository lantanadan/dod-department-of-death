<i>DOD - Department of Death</i> is a love letter to <i>Grim Fandango</i> by Lucasarts. In this game, you play as yourself, recently deceased, and now the latest travel agent at El Marrow's DOD. Your job is to study the dossiers before you, and sell an appropriate travel package to each client. You'll get a 5% commission on packages they can afford, but you'll have to cover the difference if they can't. Can you make it through a whole week?
I developed this game for the Jamsepticeye game jam (October 3-5, 2025) and the source code is MIT licensed!

Assets were developed personally or open licensed from Pixabay or OpenGameArt. The CRT shader was found at GodotShaders. No AI was used in the making of this game.

All code is written in GDSCript. Please excuse its rudimentary nature! I'm not a programmer by trade and also I only had a weekend to develop the whole thing.
